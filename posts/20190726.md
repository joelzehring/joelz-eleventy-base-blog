I've been very interested in technology for a very long time. As a kid and an adult, I played with computers personally and professionally. As a teacher, I leveraged the web as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128072945/http://zixthgrade.edublogs.org/" target="_blank">classroom tool</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181205050100/http://joelzehring.edublogs.org/" target="_blank">professional development resource</a>. In my spare time, I hacked on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509061233/http://wiilearn.edublogs.org/" target="_blank">Nintendo Wiis</a> and flashed custom ROMs on Android phones.

In January 2019, I resolved to turn my interest and occasional hobby into a self-directed course of study. I started with Python, working through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" target="_blank">Guido van Rossum's Python tutorial</a>.

I hacked together a couple simple Python apps and realized quickly that it was really hard to share these apps with my family to show off what I was learning. So in February I shifted gears to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" target="_blank">Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS</a>, then moved on to <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript</a>.

I found additional resources through Pima County Public Library, working through <a href="https://pima.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1821950091" target="_blank">David McFarland's CSS: The Missing Manual</a> in April.

With my new knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I hacked together my first web app: <a href="https://biblememorygame.netlify.com/" target="_blank">a Bible memory game</a>. It's far from done, but it's been a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP</a> to remind me that I can build and ship something of value.

In June, I found <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. I hustled through their Responsive Web Design program and claimed the first of six certifications. My prior study made it a little easier to complete, I think. Now I'm working through the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures program. The early topics are mostly review from my prior foray into JavaScript.

My goal: transition from a web development enthusiast to a web development professional.
