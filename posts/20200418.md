With a month left in my boot camp program, we're going all-in on React.js. For our first solo project, I built a memory-style game that works a little different than the typical matching game. It was great way to reinforce how React components pass props and how to manage and update state. That whole props passing thing cause me more than a few hang ups, but once I got the hang of it, things came together pretty well on the local development server. Deploying was another headeache, and after battling with Github Pages, I went to Netlify (where this site is hosted) and got the Github repo deployed with minimal effort or issue.

Deployed app [here](https://elated-euler-70afaa.netlify.app/) and repo [here](https://github.com/joelzehring/pic-click-2).
