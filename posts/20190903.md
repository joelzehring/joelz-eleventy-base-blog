React is just far enough away from plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I've been having a hard time actually building with it. Then I stumbled across <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">this tutorial</a> on the official React site, and it slowly started to click. Now I've got a project with a few React components strung together to make a really basic random kid picker web app.
