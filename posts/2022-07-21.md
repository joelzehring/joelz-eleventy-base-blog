Using multiple 1080P monitors is great for productivity, but I got to a point where I wanted more... More screen real estate to see more code and more windows. So I started researching monitors and I quickly stumbled on a [not-so-novel](https://www.androidauthority.com/4k-tv-as-a-monitor-3172039/) idea: why not just use a [43-inch 4K TV](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hisense-43-class-a6g-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-android-tv/6454349.p?skuId=6454349) as a computer monitor?

__43 inches is too big for me.__

A 43-inch 4K TV is basically four 21-inch screens positioned in a two-by-two grid. To look at and use the upper and outer areas of this layout, I found myself squinting, turning my head, and craning my neck. I did it enough that I just ended up using Microsoft's excellent [PowerToys for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) to quickly size and position my windows low and in the center of the screen and basically ignored the top and sides of the screen.

__Text was hard to read.__

I modified TV settings for brightness and sharpness. I turned on "Game Mode", which greatly improved how smooth most text appeared on the extra-large screen. I increased the scale in Windows display settings. I [tweaked Windows ClearType settings](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/adjust-cleartype-windows-10). After all my research and configuring, my eyes still felt tired and strained after a normal work day. Text on websites actually looked pretty good. But the default font in Microsoft apps, especially Outlook, frequently appeared rough and uneven, and I consistently had to squint and strain to peruse my inbox.

I'm hoping to try a [slightly smaller 4K monitor](https://www.costco.com/lg-32%22-class-4k-uhd-freesync-monitor.product.100975854.html) to get the best of both worlds: a large-but-not-too-large screen with a lot of pixels for displaying more content.
