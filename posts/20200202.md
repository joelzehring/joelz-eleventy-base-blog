jQuery may be past it's prime, but it can still play a key part in learning web development. [Oscar Otero](https://oscarotero.com/) put up a sweet [jQuery Cheatsheet](https://oscarotero.com/jquery/) that I find myself returning to frequently. It's a great way to browse jQuery selectors and methods and get a feel for some of the things JavaScript can do when it comes to manipulating the DOM and dynamically generating content.
