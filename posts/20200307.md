I've been slowly wrapping my head around back end development concepts, and all the effort has culminated in a simple Heroku app that takes user input, compares that input against a small set of data, and returns the best match. The components of the app are all routed through Express.js, which added a whole different level of complexity to the process of creating a deployable app. I got all the JavaScript and HTML wired up in Express and working over a local Node server, then slowly got the app logic hammered out across several server, routing, and jQuery files. The upside: it works! The downside: it's ugly. Nevertheless, the deployed app can be found [here](https://joelz-friend-finder.herokuapp.com/) and the repo [here](https://github.com/joelzehring/friendfinder).
