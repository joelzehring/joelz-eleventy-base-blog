Had the chance to tag along at another meet up, this one connected with a Facebook group of folks here in Tucson leveraging freeCodeCamp for learning to code. What a great time. Something about talking code with smart people in real life... Here's one take-away for me: Wherever you're at in your coding journey, you're not alone. Someone has been through the same thing before you and would be happy to help you. Someone else newer than you would be happy to learn from you. And these people live in your town. Looking forward to the next one.
